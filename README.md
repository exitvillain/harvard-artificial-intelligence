Hey guys! Here are all my projects from the course Harvard's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. It was an amazing intro to A.I. To prove that I completed it, I included my verified certificate.
This repository is more to show prospective employers what I have been doing. Not really for people still completing the course to look. So don't look here if you are still doing the course!
