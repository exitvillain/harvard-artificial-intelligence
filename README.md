Welcome to my repository showcasing all the projects I completed during **Harvard's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. This course provided an amazing introduction to A.I. concepts, and I’m proud to share my work here.

### About This Repository
- These projects represent my journey through the course, applying core A.I. principles and Python programming to solve real-world problems.
- To demonstrate my completion of the course, I’ve included my **verified certificate**.

### Note to Visitors
This repository is intended for **prospective employers** and anyone curious about my A.I. journey. If you’re still completing the course, I recommend not using this repository as a reference to avoid spoilers.
